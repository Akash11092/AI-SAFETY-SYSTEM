An AI-based Driver Safety System developed to improve road safety by continuously monitoring driver alertness in real time.
The system uses computer vision techniques implemented with OpenCV and MediaPipe.
Facial landmarks are analyzed to calculate Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) for detecting eye closure.
Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR) is used to identify yawning and fatigue levels.
The application processes live video input from a standard webcam.
When drowsiness or inattention is detected, instant audio alerts are triggered.
This helps prevent accidents caused by driver fatigue and distraction.
The system is lightweight, efficient, and suitable for real-time usage.
It can be deployed in personal and commercial vehicles.
Future enhancements include GPS tracking, cloud monitoring, and mobile app integration.
